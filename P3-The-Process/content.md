Ready to create your own game? Read on!

##Step 1: Brainstorm with the MS Crew
Contact <hello@makeschool.com> to discuss your game idea. We'll help you brainstorm and refine it!

##Step 2: Shoot for a First Playable Build!
Start from one of the Kobold2D templates or from scratch, and start cranking out code! You should create a profile page for your game in the game tab so the community can see your progress.

A first playable build is a version of your game that can be entirely composed of placeholder art, have missing menus, and broken elements, but that allows the player to experience and understand the core gameplay of your game.

##Step 3: Playtest and Iterate
Playtest your game, iterate on your design, and keep the community updated as frequently as possible with new versions of your game! By now you will be incorporating art we are giving you and your game will start to look polished!

##Step 4: Ship a Minimum Viable Game
Once you have the core of your game down and some real art incorporated, why not release it through us as a free game? As long as it's feature complete, we're happy to discuss publishing it. We've published 17 games already and we'd love to publish yours too! We'll do the art for your game and give give you tools that will let you log events to our servers when players take certain actions in your game, track high scores with leaderboards, award players achievements, and make your game multiplayer with Facebook.

Once your game is on the App Store we'll leverage our network to get you at least a few hundred players so you can get real feedback from them. We'll also give you a custom dashboard just for your game so you can view the events as they get logged, real-time. This will allow you to tweak and improve your game based on how real players interact with it!

##Step 5: Iterate and Improve
After getting feedback from real players, constantly fix issues and add new features until you are ready for a real, proper launch. When you get to this stage, make sure to keep an open line of communication with us so we can discuss marketing details.
