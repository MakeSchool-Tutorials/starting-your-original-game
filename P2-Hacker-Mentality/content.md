Let's get this straight - the original definition of a hacker is not someone who writes malicious code. A hacker is a creator, an innovator, and a builder. So what is the Hacker Mentality?

The hacker mentality is a motto, an ideology, and a way of life. It seperates the thinkers from the doers.

Creators and inventors have always faced impossible problems, accompanied by the hopeless feeling of realizing you are in way over your head. This deters most, they give up and think to themselves 'man, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates must be of a different species.'

But not you. You are a hacker. You love the thrill of drowning in a sea of knowledge. You love the struggle and the grind of conquering problem after problem. And while you might have have no clue what you're doing, you take solace in the fact that anybody who invented anything was once right where you are now.

#Quotes from Famous Hackers:

"The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete." -Mark Zuckerberg, Founder, Facebook

"All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a) not having money and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every single thing that we came out with that was really great, I'd never once done that thing in my life." -Steve Wozniak, Founder, Apple

"If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control." -Alexis Ohanian, Founder, Reddit

##Tips for Hackers
1. Google is your best friend. Remember, every problem you run into has probably been solved by someone else. The best advice we can give you, and we will give it again and again, is: Google it. Can't remember the syntax for a specific task? Google it! Getting an obsure error? Paste in into Google!
2. Tweak and test, nobody writes perfect code on the first try. If something doesn't work, fiddle around with all the individual parts until you can figure out whats wrong.
3. Keep calm and carry on. Never give up. Never surrender. If you're totally stuck shoot us an email! That's what we are here for!
