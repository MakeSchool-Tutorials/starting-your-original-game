Do not try and write the perfect tutorial. That's impossible. Instead only try and realize the truth - there is no tutorial.

We want you to think instead in terms of game progression and pacing. Teaching players how to play your game is a process, not an event. There are three basic rules to introducing players to your game:

1. - Never take them out of the game.

2. - Never teach something now that can be taught later

3. - Never have more than a sentence of text onscreen at a time, and not more than three sentences/minute.

#The Importance of Progression
Let's say that after playing a minute of your game, 30% of people continue playing your game. Almost nothing you can do to your game, be it in the form of better features, more gameplay, push notification reminders, or anything really, can improve your game's success more than improving the experience during that first minute.

If you can go from 30% of people to 60% of people making it through your first minute, you've improved your game's success by more than any other feature probably ever will.

##1) Never take the player out of the game
You should teach the player as they play. As much as possible integrate the teaching into the gameplay. Respect the players' time - they have hundreds of thousands of choices on the App Store and they chose to try out your game. People downloaded your game to play it, not to be lectured, so let them play!

##2) Never teach something now that can be taught later
When do you need to introduce a new mechanic? When the game is no longer fun. When do you need to explain a mechanic? The first time you use it.

This rule is hard to follow intuitively because so many PC and console games break it and set a bad example. Why? When people have paid \$30-\$60 for a game, they will pay attention to a tutorial. The developer isn't nearly as concerned about whether the player will bounce in the first 10 seconds. That's not the primary challenge they face, so they don't spend time optimizing for it. Games used to ship with manuals players were expected to read before starting!

As a mobile game developer you are fighting for every second of your players' time. Your biggest challenge is keeping people around. People will literally quit your game within the first 10 seconds if they aren't pleased and they will never return. An easy way to make your game boring in the first few seconds is to teach the player too many things at once.

At an abstract level, at the start of the game you should give the player a primary objective and a primary action they can use to achieve that objective. Once that action-objective pair is no longer fun, you can introduce a second objective or a new obstacle to the first objective along with corresponding new actions the player can take. This can continue several times depending on the game. Some games only have one objective and one action, some build complexity over time.

##3) Limit Onscreen Text
People don't read in mobile games. It's as simple as that. Sometimes you have to make them. If you do, never have more than one sentence onscreen. Limit yourself to three per minute of gameplay, tops. Make it blink at first or slowly reveal to draw the users' attention to it. If at all possible, explain things contextually or with arrows and other visual cues.

#Classic Mistakes to Avoid
Just to recap...

1. - Preventing the player from playing for more than a few seconds. Players downloaded you game to play it, not to read instructions. Try and keep them entertained by letting them play as they learn.

2. - Including a separate tutorial or instructions section. The reality is, and we've observed this empirically, nobody will read it. They will try to jump straight into gameplay and if they don't get it immediately, they will quit.

3. - Expecting your users to read text. Sounds hypocritical for a site built around lots of tutorials, we know, but believe us when we say that your users can handle about one sentence of text per instruction screen, if that. Ideally you're limiting yourself to "tap here" or "avoid these" or "collect these for more points!"

4. - Telling the user to "click" on something. "Tap" is the word you are looking for.

#Testing your Game's Progression
The rules here are simple. You can't test this aspect of your game with the same person twice and you can't talk to them while they are testing. Once they've seen your game once, they know how to play and thus are useless in judging the progression of your game. Try and get at least 3 different, new people to test each new version of your game and be real with yourself. The player is never wrong, if 7/10 people can't figure out your game, they aren't dumb, it's your game that needs work.
