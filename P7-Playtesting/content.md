Following these instructions will increase your game's chances of success dramatically.

##Rule 1
Playtest often.

##Rule 2
Do it with new people. Someone who has played your game before will not interact with it like someone who is seeing it for the first time. Once your game is out in the wild, everyone will be seeing it for the first time, so that's the kind of playtesting you want to do the most of. It's of course ok to have regular playtesters, but your best insights will come from new people.

##Rule 3
Do it with strangers. Your friends won't tell you how much your game sucks. Buy random people coffee at coffeeshops, camp out at pizza places with free pizza, etc...

We're not making this up. We know indie studios that do this.

##Rule 4
Keep quiet. Before your game has a tutorial, it's ok to briefly show people how to play. After it has a tutorial, you should be completely quiet. If you have to explain something it means the player got stuck. You won't be able to explain stuff to players in the wild, so you are ruining your playtest session's utility by chiming in. If someone gets completely stuck and you still want more testing out of them, make note of where they got stuck, show them how to continue, and work really hard to fix whatever got them stuck.

##Rule 5
Don't ask people how they want your game to be. You'll get so much contradictory advice it's best to not make a habit of asking. Be polite when people give advice, but at the end of the day it's your game. Be much more interested in peoples' facial expressions as they play, whether they get stuck anywhere, and whether they continue playing without further prompting or whether they get bored quickly.
