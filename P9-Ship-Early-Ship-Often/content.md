You're lucky. To release a game back in the day, you actually had to ship copies across the world. Now, just hand us your code and we'll do the rest.

Playtesting is a crucial step in the development process to be sure, but it is limited. It takes time and you can't playtest with a thousand people. So how do you get feedback from 100 players?

#Ship your game
Fight the urge to strive for perfection on the first try. You'll never release your game if you have that mindset. Not only that, you'll be developing blind and without user feedback.

Remember that you should be making games people want to play, not games you want people to want to play. If you ship early, you'll get the feedback you need to make a game people want to play.

Oftentimes there is a subset of the game you are making that can be released before the full game is done. Get in touch with us during the development process and we'll discuss whether this is an option for your game.

If you publish your game through MakeGamesWithUs, we'll give you analytics so you can see how many players are playing your game and how far they make it. We'll even tell you how it compares to other games in our network, so you'll know what your data means. We can offer suggestions on how to improve your game because we've seen a lot of them, so the problems you're running into are likely problems we've seen before. What better feedback is there than real, hard data? There isn't.

#Conclusion
As soon as your game is bug-free-ish and playable, release it for free (to get more players). If you release it through us, we'll promote it enough to get you a few hundred players. You can then analyze the data you're getting, see what is and isn't working, tweak, and update your game.

After a few iterations, you can change your game to paid if you so desire or add in-app purchases, and we're happy to guide you through that process as well.
